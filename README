== Changes
I've updated it to work with FF 4, fixed a bug with the .live() and I think that's it.

I looked a lot of right-click libraries before choosing this one, I really think it's The best.


== jQuery.contextMenu.js
Overwrite the rightclick and show a context menu

== TODO 
rewrite to be more jquery 1.4ish
themeroller support
cleanup / documentation


You can checkout the original plugin and it's documentation <a href="http://www.trendskitchens.co.nz/jquery/contextmenu/"> here</a>.

These demos won't work with FF4, but you can check them out on IE/safari/chrome.
